The accumulated deficit of **$859.7 million** is a critical concern that requires immediate attention.\n\n#### Conclusion\nBig Bear.ai Holdings, Inc. currently does not align with the characteristics of a financially healthy company.

For Q3 2025, the company reported revenues of $33.1 million, down from $41.5 million in the previous quarter, yet achieved a net income of $2.5 million, a significant turnaround from a loss of $15.1 million. Despite this positive shift, the company faces an accumulated deficit of $859.7 million and ongoing operational losses, raising concerns about its financial health. The planned acquisition of Ask Sage is a strategic move intended to enhance market position and operational capabilities, but it introduces risks related to integration and competition. Moving forward, management is focused on improving revenue growth and operational efficiency, with investors advised to closely monitor revenue trends and integration progress as key indicators of the company's future trajectory.",
